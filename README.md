# About dev

### What is your name?

My name is Denis Makhortov. Sometimes I use `jalhund` nickname&#x20;

### Who are you?

Just a man who likes turn-based strategy and started to create his own in his spare time

### Tell more about you

When I was 17-18, I created my first game. It's Civilization Path ( you can find it in Google Play: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DenisMakhortov.CivilizationPath](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DenisMakhortov.CivilizationPath))

Yes, it's ugly and not beautiful. But there was many people who liked it. I was a student and decided to create another game, more interesting and customizable

After 1 year I released another game: Cold Path (Google Play link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DenisMakhortov.ColdPath](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DenisMakhortov.ColdPath))

It's too much better and detailed. Also you can create your own maps, scenarios and servers. Sources of the Map Editor and the Server are opened and available on github.\

### How many people are developing the game?

I am alone, but I did not do everything alone.

The music was not created by me, its authors are listed in the About menu. Some in-game scenarios were not created by me, but by the players in the scenario editor. Their authors are also written in that menu

Also, a lot of cool ideas were written by the players. It will not be possible to write everyone, but know that I am very grateful to you for your support and help in development.

### What is the engine?

Game engine: Defold

Language: Lua

For things that are not available in the engine, it is possible to write native extensions in C/C++

I really like the engine, ideal for 2D games. At first, everything is difficult and incomprehensible, but over time, you begin to appreciate the speed of development and its other advantages.

### Is the game code open or closed?

The code of the game itself is closed. I do not plan to open it, since a lot of time was spent on development. There are purchases in the game itself, the money from them goes to rent servers, develop the game, etc.

The server code is open. The server is the core of the game with little scripts around. I opened it to give more options for players to change the gameplay. Now that the server code is open, anyone can run their own server and use it however they like.

The map editor code is open. Use it however you want.

**Can I take as a basis the code of the server or the map editor in order to make my own game based on it?**

Yes. I will be glad that there will be one more good game in the world

### Future plans?

Create Cold Path 2, but there is very little free time.
