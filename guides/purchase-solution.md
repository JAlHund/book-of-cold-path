# Purchase issues solution

### Game did not sync purchases

1. Close game\(you can use Exit button in the game\)
2. Turn on internet. Make sure there are no connection problems
3. Open game

Purchases should be made available. I advise you to check availability not in the Premium menu, but directly trying to access the game features \(for example, open Scenario Editor\)

### Wrong google account

The game checks for purchases from the default Google account. Check that default Google account is the account from which you made purchases. Default Google account is the first account added to the system

### If none of the above helps

If none of the above helped, then try clear game data and open game
