# Checking map in editor

To check how the map will look in the game, close the editor, reopen and select the Map editor

You will have a map loaded as it will look in the game. Also in this mode you can change the center of the province \(where the icons will be drawn from\). To do this, click on the rectangle to the right of the Change offset label. If rectangular green - the mode of changing the center of the province is on, if red - off. You can change the center of a province by clicking on it

Attention! Changes are saved when you click on the mode switch at the top. After you change the center of the provinces, be sure to click on that button
