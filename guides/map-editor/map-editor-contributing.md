# Contributing

The source code is completely open and available at the link: [https://github.com/JAlHund/cold-path-map-editor](https://github.com/JAlHund/cold-path-map-editor)  
Everyone can take part. But something tells me that only I will do, so I will write the basic rules for making a contribution:  
1\) Always test changes 2\) One Pull Request - one task \(to make it easier to check\) This is the case if you want to push your changes to my repository. You can clone and do whatever you want.  
  
To work on the editor, you need to download the Defold game engine, download the sources and open the map editor project in the engine.
