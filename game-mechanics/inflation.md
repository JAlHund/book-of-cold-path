# Inflation

Inflation will start when the player accumulates the amount of money equal to income per turn \* 5

Inflation is expressed as a percentage, where the minimum value \(0%\) is income per turn \* 5, __and the maximum value \(95%\) is income per turn \* 30.

Inflation reduces the player's income per turn.

### Example:

Luxembourg does not spend money. Data obtained by experimental verification in the game. Population growth was practically stopped \(due to population growth by 31 turns, the income from the population should have been 775 instead of 774 without growth. This is insignificant and does not affect the overall picture\)



| Turn | Money | Income per turn | Inflation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 774 | 774 | 0% |
| 6 | 4501 | 627 | 19% |
| 15 | 9328 | 469 | 39% |
| 31 | 15110 | 280 | 64% |
